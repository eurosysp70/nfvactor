# NFVactor

This is the source code for NFVactor. It contains the source code of the runtime (in ./runtime directory) and some basic scripts (in ./eval directory) for configuring the runtime. We are still cleaning up the source code and we aim to provide a simple evaluation script in the future. 

Currently, to build the system in Ubuntu 14.04 OS, simply execute setup.sh.
